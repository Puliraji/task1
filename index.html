One of the highest-paid Telugu film actors,[3] he also owns the production house G. Mahesh Babu Entertainment.

The younger son of veteran Telugu actor Krishna, Babu made his debut as a child artist in a cameo role in Needa (1979), at the age of four[4],and acted in eight other films as a child artist. He made his debut as a lead actor with Rajakumarudu (1999) which won him the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[5] Babu achieved his breakthrough with the supernatural drama Murari (2001), and the action film Okkadu (2003). He went on to act in other commercially successful films such as Athadu (2005), Pokiri (2006), Dookudu (2011), Businessman (2012), Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013), Srimanthudu (2015), Bharat Ane Nenu (2018), Maharshi (2019), Sarileru Neekevvaru (2020) and Sarkaru Vaari Paata (2022). Pokiri held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film, Maharshi won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film, while Sarileru Neekevvaru, his highest grosser, collected over ₹260 crore at the box office.[6][7]

Referred to in the media and by his fans as Prince, he is one of the most popular actors of Telugu cinema.[8][9] In addition to being an actor, he is a humanitarian and philanthropist – co running the charitable trust and non-profit organisation Heal A Child .[10] He is also associated with Rainbow Hospitals as their goodwill ambassador.[11] He entered into the film exhibition business alongside the late Narayandas Narang of Asian Group with the inauguration of the seven-screen multiplex, AMB cinemas at Gachibowli, Hyderabad.[12] He married actress Namrata Shirodkar in 2005, with whom he has a son and a daughter.</p>
<h3 id="personal life"></h3>
<p>Family
Babu married his co-star Namrata Shirodkar on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu (2005).[225] The couple's first child was born on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.[226] The boy was named Gautam.[227] On 20 July 2012, Shirodkar gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.[228] Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.[229]

Babu is the fourth child in a family of five children. His elder brother Ramesh Babu was a film producer and was also an actor. Mahesh Babu's eldest sister Padmavathi is married to Galla Jayadev, an industrialist and Member of the Indian Parliament from the Telugu Desam Party.[230] His elder sister Manjula is a film producer, director, and an actress.[citation needed] Priyadarshini, his younger sister, is married to Sudheer Babu, who later made his debut as an actor in Telugu cinema.[231]

Telugu actress and filmmaker Vijaya Nirmala was Babu's step-mother; actor Naresh is his step-brother.[232]

Philanthropy
Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so.[233] He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[234] He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical treatment.[235] In October 2014, he donated ₹25 lakh to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for reconstruction of areas destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud. Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala later donated ₹25 lakh to the fund.[236]

Jayadev announced in February 2015 that Babu would adopt Krishna's native village Burripalem, a minor panchayat in Tenali, and would address basic needs of the community such as potable drinking water and better roads and drainage systems.[237] Later, Namrata Shirodkar was quoted saying that they had adopted Siddapur village in Mahbubnagar district upon consultation with Telangana's Rural Development minister K. T. Rama Rao.[238]

Legal issues
In September 2004, Babu and director Gunasekhar attended a rally organised by his fans at Warangal for the promotional activities of Arjun. He and his fans allegedly raided two video libraries and assaulted their owners who were circulating unauthorised CDs of the film. Cases under IPC section 448 (criminal trespass), section 427 (mischief) and section 366 (kidnap) were registered on him, who was the principal accused, and five others.[239] Later, a delegation from the Telugu film industry, including his father Krishna, Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Allu Aravind and D. Suresh Babu, approached the then chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy to intervene in this case. Regarding the issue, Babu said that while cases were booked against him on "the basis of wrong information," not a single case had been booked against the person dealing in bootlegged CDs, which he found the "funniest" thing.[240] Actor Pawan Kalyan openly supported Babu throughout the episode.[241] Babu surrendered in the district court in September 2004 and appeared before the court again in April 2006. Babu and the others were exonerated after the final hearing in July 2006.[242]</p>
